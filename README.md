# AP-CSA-FINAL / Time Adventure Game

This is my Java Swing AP CSA Final of my "Time Adventure" game

## Description

This is a simulation type of game with statistics on the top and action buttons on the bottom. The Objective of the game
is to reach the end of the path way marked with x's and o's without dying from hunger or bodily harm along the way.
x's on the path indicate immediate harm from a variety of enemies, it is crucial to pay close attention to your health 
that is displayed since damage towards your character is random based of the enemy. On the journey, you will start with one 
horse that has a speed of 3 places each time you move, the stats of your horse will be placed above as well. When pressing 
move button, the user will move appropriately to the speed type it is at, which is either walking or horse travel. If your 
horse dies from either hunger or from health the speed will be set to walking speed. Pressing the move button will also 
result in the loss of hunger as well as an update to the daysTraveled counter in increments of 1. There will be an image 
on the top right of the screen to indicate the well being of only the user (green for healthy, yellow for needs attention,
and red for critical condition). Death of the user will result from damage from enemies causing health to drop to or below 0 or 
hunger from lack of food or lack of eating food. Death will shows a message saying you have died.
